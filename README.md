Website demonstrating FastAPI and HTMX for Quant applications

FastAPI is a state-of-the-art Python web backend.

HTMX is a radical newish Javascript library that works by providing functionality for a piece of HTML to update itself by calling the backend and replacing itself with the HTML returned from the backend.  This allows for modern, interactive, responsive web pages with almost all of the business logic and processing being done on the backend.

HTMX reputedly works well for web pages of low-to-moderate complexity.  (A highly interactive web page will still need a heavyweight Javascript framework such as React.)  This demo website is an exploration of how far the simplicity of FastAPI + HTMX can be pushed to build applications for Quantitative Analysis and similar things.
