        <p>Calculate the schedule of payments to amortise (pay back) a loan with interest.</p>
        <p>The calculation uses monthly compounding interest.  That is, if we define:</p>
        <dl>
            <dd>\( R : \) The Annual Percentage Rate (APR) expressed as a fraction (not percentage)</dd>
            <dd>\( r : \) The monthly interest rate (as a fraction, not percentage)</dd>
        </dl>
        <p>Then \(R\) and \(r\) are related by:
           $$(1 + R) = (1 + r)^{12}$$</p>
        <p>Therefore, \( r = (1 + R)^{\frac{1}{12}} -1 \)</p>

        <p>Further define:</p>
        <dl>
            <dd>\(P:\) Principal (amount borrowed)</dd>
            <dd>\(n:\) Loan term in months</dd>
        </dl>
        <p>Then the size of each monthly payment, \(A\), is given by the Annuity Formula
            $$ A = P \frac{r (1 + r)^n}{(1 + r)^n - 1} $$
        </p>
        <p>Immediately after each monthly payment, the balance remaining on the loan is known as the
            Current Capital Balance.</p>
        <p>The interest accrued each month is calculated by: \( \mathrm{Current\;Capital\; Balance} \times r \)</p>

            <strong>ROUNDING:</strong> All rounding is done for the borrower's benefit:  The monthly payment (annuity)
            is rounded <strong>up</strong>, so the loan is paid back quicker.  (Consequently, the final payment may
            be smaller than the regular payments.)  And the interest accrued each month is rounded
            <strong>down</strong>, so the borrower pays less interest.  These simple rounding rules easily allow exact
            replication in eg. spreadsheets.
